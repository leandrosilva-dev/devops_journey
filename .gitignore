# Docker
# Ignore Docker build context files that are temporary or large
# For this simple app, it's less critical, but good practice for larger projects.
# .dockerignore can also be used for this purpose within Docker builds.
# docker-compose.override.yml # If you have local overrides not meant for repo

# Kubernetes
# Kubeconfig files (if generated locally and not managed by a secure external system)
# Usually, these are outside the project directory or handled by cloud CLIs.
